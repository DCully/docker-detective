## TODO
* develop the top-level container/nav to go between the image view, layers view, and individual layers
* render the individual layers as FileSystem components the same way as we're now rendering the image file system
* identify files in lower layers that get whited out in higher-up layers (server side)
* figure out how to visualize whited-out files or directories and surface how much bloat there is
